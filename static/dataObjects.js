Rawkus joined Sentinels from FaZe Clan for the team's Valorant Champions run in December after a dominant run the past year in VCT competition. However, at Masters: Berlin, Sentinels ended up being upset by Envy — now OpTic Gaming — in the quarterfinals. Nonetheless, Sentinels still had another shot at stardom at Valorant Champions, but that event once again ended in heartbreak for the team. A 2-1 loss in the group B decider to KRÜ Esports abruptly ended the team's 2021 year, which was headlined by a multitude of impressive finishes, including a championship at Masters: Reykjavik.",
        txt2: "According to Rawkus's TwitLonger, his addition to Sentinels from FaZe was done on a loan basis, with the expiration date of that loan being the start of the new year due to how quickly he took up the offer. Furthermore, Sentinels were in discussions with FaZe to acquire him as a full-time coach for the team, but neither side were able to reach an agreement due to 'buyout complications'. This means that while Rawkus is once again a member of FaZe, he is not a part of their active lineup, and he has also made it clear that he is looking for new opportunities with other teams as a player."

Later that month, the team announced its roster for the Halo Championship Series, marking the beginning of a new era for the Green Wall.",

However, the team consistently made deep playoff bracket runs, and their efforts eventually netted them a spot at Valorant Champions. Unfortunately, a group stage exit from the event sent the team into 2022 with unmet aspirations of being North America's best team."
