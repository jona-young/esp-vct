            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The story being told by my website will follow the Valorant Esport. 
                Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter video game and the site will 
                explore the news and results revolving around this event. The structure of
                the website is inspired by TIME.com and will be implemented with the CSS 
                grid method which will allow for easy organizing of elements and placement 
                of elements as the window changes dimensions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h3>
            <p>
                The two inspirations for this website are vlr.gg, and TIME.com. I enjoy the 
                barebones aspect of information that vlr.gg provides in results and news about 
                teams and matches. TIME.com is a benchmark I can use for a website that is 
                built around providing news in a fully responsive design. They are a contemporary 
                world-news media organization with tried and true methods as to disseminating 
                information.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Alternative Text for Images</b>
                <br>
                Alternative text is implemented for all images in the main body explaining the 
                photo and what it shows. For twitter posts, it briefly summarizes the tweet. 
                There is also alt text to identify the menu icon in the header as well as the 
                social media icons in the footer.
                <br><br>

                <b>Colour Contrast</b>
                <br>
                Attention to detail has been paid with regards to ensuring all elements on the 
                page have sufficient contrast with the background colour it falls in.
                <br><br>


                <b>Headings</b>
                <br>
                For each section of each individual webpage I outlined the headings in a hierarchy. 
                h1 tags were expressly only used for a main title on the page, otherwise h2 tags 
                were used if there were multiple headings of the same hierarchy. Any sub-headings 
                were given the appropriate header tags h3, h4, etc.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Mobile Compatibility</b>
                <br>
                The website was designed with a mobile-first approach for a screen size with a 
                soft intended viewing width of 320px. From there as the webpage is scaled up in 
                width, a media queries is set at 1024px and above. The website uses CSS grids 
                so it is easy to scale up the elements on the webpage.
                <br><br>

                <b>Content Formatting</b>
                <br>
                The goal with the layout of the website is to provide modular sections that are 
                brief and easy to skim through. This is evident on the home page with distinct 
                sections that the user can click which will send them to the various parts of 
                the website (news, events, match information, subscription page, etc). 
                <br><br>


                <b>Page Layout</b>
                <br>
                The layout of the pages has been focused on to provide only necessary information 
                pertaining to the goal of the page. The homepage displays information from all 
                parts of the website in small sections. The goal of the homepage is to provide 
                a summary of the content available around the Valorant Esports scene. As you 
                drill down into the news, matches, events, subscribe page, the goals of those 
                pages are to provide information explicitly about those topics.
                <br><br>
                Laying out the information in modular sections using CSS grid made it personally 
                easier to keep a mind-map of how the content should be laid out and I believe it 
                shows as each piece of the individual webpages has a defined and clear space 
                that it uses.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Loading data into HTML using Javscript</b>
                <br>
                The two methods I learned to implement data into HTML was through Handlebars JS 
                and by interacting with the DOM. For HandlebarsJS, I wanted to implement HTML 
                into the index.html and read the official documentation for HandlebarsJS on how 
                to do so with partial blocks. I also learned to load data by finding elements 
                on the webpage based off class name and id and assigning values from objects 
                loaded into the scripts. For both methods I loaded data objects and adapted it 
                to fit into my use case.
                <br><br>

                <b>Tournament Brackets</b>
                <br>
                Implementing tournament brackets was necessary for an esports site as it covers 
                tournaments with matches and I needed to find a way to implement a tournament 
                bracket. There was a solution hosted on CodePen that used an unordered list and 
                through CSS styling designed it to look like a tournament bracket. The changes 
                I made to this implementation were changing the static elements (team names and 
                scores) and assigned them further id values to easily populate the tournament 
                bracket based off dynamic values pulled from an object.
                <br><br>

                <b>Sidebar Menu</b>
                <br>
                A feature that most sites have for easy site navigation are sidebar menus. I 
                wanted to implement this because they are especially useful in mobile versions 
                of site to keep the information segmented and organized. There is a tutorial on 
                W3 Schools that I used which explained a basic template through the use of HTML, 
                CSS, and Javascript. I adapted this implementation with a layer that covers the 
                rest of the page when the sidebar menu slides out. If the user clicks outside 
                the sidebar, the menu will close going back to the mainpage.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
            <p>
                The primary aspect of the website that worked well is the implementation of the 
                CSS grid method. In the midterm website project, I implemented responsiveness 
                heavily through more media queries and various position assignments. It created 
                a lot of CSS changes and overall was a messy implementation. I read documentation 
                on implementing a CSS grid style and it was a lot easier to manage and maneuver 
                once I understood how it worked. Resizing by change grid-column and grid-row 
                values was very easy overall and it kept everything organized.
                <br><br>
                The second aspect of the website that worked well is the communication with the 
                DOM to load, manipulate, and change data based off user input. I did a lot of 
                work to assign IDs and class names to elements in order to dynamically assign 
                those elements with the appropriate data. I separated the script functions into 
                their own files and created a dataObject.js file which housed the data. I felt 
                it was appropriate as if one was to pull data from an API and interact with the 
                data to load into a webpage.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h3>
            <p>
                I believe I could have focused more on building extensive accessibility features. 
                Implementing the feature for resizable text for those with vision impairments, 
                or a focus to ensure keyboard shortcuts could be smooth for those that do not 
                use a mouse would have been beneficial. More research would have to be done to 
                implement those features but it would have definitely been beneficial and worth 
                it.
